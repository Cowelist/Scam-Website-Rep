                <p>There exist many types of scam, and some are for different purposes, but they all have one thing in common, that is to exploit the user for example like the “free currency scam”.
                    The “free currency scam” is a scam where it requires the user to enter their password and username on a picked website. This can scale from real life currency to in game currency and the terrifying part of it is how effective it is. This is because the main targets for these types of scams are mostly younger and elderly people. As they know less of the internet. This could lead to them blindly trusting an unsafe source which has happened multiple times in the past years. 
                </p>
                <p>Fortnite is one of the most popular games in the world, which has attracted millions of players especially the younger player base, which are also vu to these “free currency scams”. When fortnite was first released to the public it became an overnight success and as time passed it became even more successful. Naturally everyone wanted to try this up and coming game, plus the game was also free, which meant that it gave you no reason to not try it. And it worked, however there was still a problem. People became board, not because of the game specifically, but more towards the avatar they were using. Queuing up hundreds of times and still see the same skin will eventually get boring, however there was an easy solution to this which was to buy cosmetics.

                    Everyone brought their skins and became happy, right? No, since the game is free and popular it also meant that the game attracted “free to play” people who either wanted to play for fun or wasn´t allowed to spend IRL (In real life) money on games. This led to the players begging their parents for money, and most of them would turn down the offer as they were only kids. This led to them becoming desperate, and in desperate times comes desperate deeds, which was the perfect time to launch the “free v-buks web site” (v-buks = fortnite currency).

                <p>Being able to analyze is a trait that everyone should have, whether it would be for work or scams.
                    Online scams are everywhere nowadays, so it´s important for you to: be aware, identify, and avoid them as much as possible, because it doesn´t take long before you become a target for these scams. 
                    Something you always must consider is whether you can trust something. This could be a person or a source especially online. The first thing you should think about is the perspective of the producer. You can ask question like “what does he gain from doing this?” or “is this too good to be true?”, either way identify the persons intention. By doing this it makes it easier to tell if a person is real or fake. And if you’re still not 100 % sure then do some more research like finding out his/her reputation.
